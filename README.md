# Neural-Network

From the scratch implemenation of a NN to predict whether the house price will be above or below the median market price.

Various experimentations have been performed to decide:
1. No of hidden layers
2. No of nodes in hidden layers
3. Various Activation Functions like sigmoid,re-Lu,softmax etc
4. Dropout was also implemented from scratch.

For Theory refer Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop.
